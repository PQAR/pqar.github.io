            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>PQAR (Plex Quantum and Atomic Research) is a research project dedicated to exploring the
                frontiers of quantum and atomic sciences. With a team of dedicated scientists, we aim to push the boundaries of knowledge and contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in
                the field of quantum and atomic research.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Physics</h2>
            <p>Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that explores the 
                behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, typically at the level of atoms and subatomic particles. It revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental 
                nature of reality by introducing concepts such as wave-particle duality, superposition, and quantum entanglement. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles and waves, 
                highlighting the probabilistic nature of subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics acknowledges that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, 
                a phenomenon famously illustrated by Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment. Quantum physics has led to the development of technologies like transistors, lasers, and MRI machines, shaping both modern physics and everyday applications in remarkable ways.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Physics</h2>
            <p>Nuclear physics is the field of science that studies atomic nuclei and their interactions. It delves into the properties and behavior of atomic nuclei, including their composition, structure, and the forces that bind protons and neutrons together within them. 
                Nuclear physics also explores the processes of nuclear reactions, such as fusion and fission, which release enormous amounts of energy and are fundamental in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. Moreover, nuclear physics plays a crucial role in understanding the origins of the universe, 
                as it examines the processes that occurred during the early moments of the Big Bang, shaping the elemental composition of the cosmos. 
                Research in nuclear physics continues to expand our knowledge of the universe and contributes to advancements in fields like energy production, medical imaging, and particle physics.</p>
